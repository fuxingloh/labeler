## Why?

> There are so many labeler why create another? ðŸ˜§

1. I want a lightweight labeler that is written in TypeScript so that it don't have to build a docker image everytime it
   runs.
2. I want a simple match first append based multi-labeler without it being a turing complete solution.
3. I want to write my rules with `.github/labeler.yml` for a single source of label truth.
4. I want to use it together with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. I don't want it to do anything else, labels only.
   1. Assume you are using GitHub branch protection (labels only).
   2. I want to run this in PR triage before everything else (labels only).
   3. Chain this action with another action; this should just be for (labels only).
