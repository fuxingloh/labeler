- [ ] Various use case 

## Configuration

Once youâ€™ve added multi-labeler to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/labeler.yml` configuration
file to the repository.

## Matchers

### PR/Issue Title: RegEx

```yml
version: v1

labels:
  - label: "feat"
    matcher:
      title: "^feat:.*"
```

### PR/Issue Body: RegEx

```yml
version: v1

labels:
  - label: "bug"
    matcher:
      body: "(\\n|.)*- \\[x\\] bug(\\n|.)*"
```

### PR Branch: RegEx

```yml
version: v1

labels:
  - label: "feat"
    matcher:
      branch: "^feat/.*"
```

### PR Commits: RegEx

Check all commits and find any match, max of 250 commits only.

```yml
version: v1

labels:
  - label: "feat"
    matcher:
      commits: "^feat: .*"
```

### PR Files: [Glob Matcher](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

Minimatch files, maximum of 3000 only.
If you use this to audit files changes, that note of the 3000 limit.

```yml
version: v1

labels:
  - label: "github"
    matcher:
      files: ".github/**"

  - label: "security"
    matcher:
      files: ["web/security/**", "security/**"]
```

## Why?

> There are so many labeler why create another? ðŸ˜§

1. I want a lightweight labeler that is written in TypeScript so that it don't have to build a docker image everytime it
   runs.
2. I want a simple match first append based multi-labeler without it being a turing complete solution.
3. I want to write my rules with `.github/labeler.yml` for a single source of label truth.
4. I want to use it together with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. I don't want it to do anything else, labels only.
    1. Assume you are using GitHub branch protection (labels only).
    2. I want to run this in PR triage before everything else (labels only).
    3. Chain this action with another action; this should just be for (labels only).
