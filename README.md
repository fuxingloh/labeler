# Multi Labeler

Multi labeler for title, comments, description, commit messages or files.

## Features

- Append based multi-labeler, using `.github/labeler.yml` as config.
- Regex Matcher:
    - PR title
    - PR comments
    - PR description
    - PR commit messages
- Glob Matcher:
    - Files
- Optional single or group based status check
- Automatically fail if `labeler.yml` is malformed, type-checked.

## Why?

> There are so many labeler why create another? ðŸ˜§

1. I want a lightweight labeler that is written in typescript so that it don't have to build a docker image everytime it
   runs.
2. I want a simple match first append based multi-labeler without it being a turing complete solution.
    * Easier to write additional label matcher.
3. I want to write my rules with `.github/labeler.yml` for a single source of label truth.
4. I want to use it together with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. I want it to push helpful status message on why rules failed and labels are produced so that new engineers knows how
   to fix it without contacting support.
7. I don't want it to do anything else, labels only.
    1. Assume you are using GitHub branch protection (labels only).
    2. I want to run this in PR triage before everything else (labels only).
