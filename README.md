- Regex Matcher:
  - PR/Issue title
  - PR/Issue body
  - PR/Issue comments
  - PR commit messages
  - PR branch name
- File Matcher:
  - Files count
  - Files any glob match
  - Files all glob match
- Generate status checks:
  - Any label match
  - All label match

file to the repository.

## Why?

> There are so many labeler why create another? ðŸ˜§

1. I want a lightweight labeler that is written in TypeScript so that it don't have to build a docker image everytime it
   runs.
2. I want a simple match first append based multi-labeler without it being a turing complete solution.
3. I want to write my rules with `.github/labeler.yml` for a single source of label truth.
4. I don't want it to do anything else, labels only.
    1. Assume you are using GitHub branch protection (labels only).
    2. I want to run this in PR triage before everything else (labels only).
    3. Chain this action with another action; this should just be for (labels only).
